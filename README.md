## Notes

Describe any challenges encountered while building the app.

My challenges in creating this app mainly had to deal with learning xCode since it was my first time using the IDE. In addition, 
creating the TableView in the earlier steps of the project was a bit challenging.
Once I was able to implement my tableview layout, I was able to use a similar implementation for in order to create
a collection view.
